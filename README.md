# NewProjectWithSwiftLint
Summary:  A clean SwiftUI project with a SwiftLint Run Script and a sample .swiftlint.yml.

This is a clean SwiftUI project that contains only enough changes (two) to run SwiftLint.

The changes can be copied to any SwiftUI project:
0.  Install SwiftLint on the computer (https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation)
1.  Drag and drop the .swiftlint.yml file from this project into your project.
2.  Create a new Run Script (select target > build phases > + > New Run Script Phase) and copy the script from this project.
